# dxgmx
dxgmx is a scratch written x86 kernel made for learning purposes. Right now the kernel loosely follows Unix conventions, is dependant on GRUB (more specifically the Multiboot 0.6.96 boot specification), and still misses core parts.

## Getting dxgmx up and running
See [The dxgmx build system](docs/building.md).
